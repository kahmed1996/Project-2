# Project-2

We are trying to Use the Census Api and a weather data to see if we can show a trend and patterns using visualizations of most populated and least populated areas. We want to see if any particular kind of weather has an impact on  population density.
The weather data, we are getting in a pdf format. We will be reading it into pandas.
