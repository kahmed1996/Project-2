# Project-2


We are trying to merge the Census data and a weather data to see if we can show a trend and patterns using visualizations of most populated and least populated areas. We want to see if any particular kind of weather has an impact on  population density.
The Census data is taken from the github project https://github.com/cestastanford/historical-us-city-populations.
This dataset is a compilation of United States historical city populations decennially between 1790 and 2010. All the data was put into a single repository so it can be accessible and improved upon by other researchers.
Then we cleaned up the data to just reflect the population from 1950 to 2010 for our projet.
The weather data was pulled from NOAA{National Oceanic & Atmosphere Administration).
